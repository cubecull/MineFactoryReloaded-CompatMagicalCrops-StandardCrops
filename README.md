MineFactoryReloaded-CompatMagicalCrops-StandardCrops
====================================================

Compatibility layer for standard crops in MagicalCrops with farming machines in MineFactory Reloaded.

The standard crops in MagicalCrops-1.6.4_3.2.0_BETA_15a don't seem to be supported in MineFactoryReloaded-2.7.9-final
so I've added support for them.

Croplist as follows:

- Blackberry
- Blueberry
- Chili
- Cucumber
- Grape
- Raspberry
- Strawberry
- Sweetcorn
- Tomato
- SugarCane

This mod adds the Crops to the Harvester, and the Seeds to the Planter.

mechaet, Xanarios released MineFactoryReloaded|MFRCompatMagicalCrops on which this work is heavily based. Their mod
was crashing because the actual magical crops from MagicalCrops had changed their names. These magical crops are already
supported in MineFactoryReloaded so I didn't see a need to add them again.

Patmo98 released a piece of work that mechaet and Xanarios based their mod on.
